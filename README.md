# Data Interpretation and Analytics
- This repository consists of R codes that I wrote as a part of my project.
- The exhaustive data set was a medium sized dataset (4 files, highest file size: 1.05 GB) which I analyzed by splitting the data set into 3 smaller files (around 350 MB each).
- After this, I just presented a few simple analytics out of the given data set.
- The data set consists of 4 different files (details of which can't be disclosed) related to Customer Loan information (Customer personal details, Loan type, Account type, monthwise Outstanding Balance for 2 years, monthwise Actual Payment for 2 years, monthwise Credit limit for 2 years, etc.)
- I have presented some analytics in the file *1.Rmd* (like month wise birthday of the customers, unique customers sorted by loan type, active customers for each loan type, etc.)
- After understanding all the variables and how the files are related, I have established a relationship between the given variables and loan interest rate and calculated the interest rate with the help of those variables (in file *2.Rmd*).
